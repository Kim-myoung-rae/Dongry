  <h2>Skin</h2>
  <p>All mammals have some hair on their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_(disambiguation)" target="_blank" title="skin definition">skin</a>, even marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and porpoises that appear to be hairless. The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. For example, the skin plays a <strong>key <u>role</u></strong> in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss.

Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. In humans, for example, the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin on the body at 0.5 mm thick and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as "crows feet" and wrinkles. The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is the thickest skin on the body as 4 mm thick. The speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen.
